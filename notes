ember color scaling doesn't really work -- one of RGB goes to 0 when dim, color changes when you scale back up

TODOs:
small scale:
- sync embers animation to bpm
- combine BPM-ified animations, turn each up/down via (redis) args
large:
- redis website

controller.ino leds mapping looks right:

  leds[(strip * NUM_LEDS_PER_STRIP) + light] = ...

layout mapping to pixel number is wrong -- e.g. lights up 2 LEDs on strip 0 (0 on strip 1) when setting 1 light on ach strip

setting layout.serpentine=false didn't help alone, also need to flip row/cols
then it works!

matrix.coord_map is probably getting set wrong, check it out to debug

ignoring for now, just flipping X/Y and getting on with life
